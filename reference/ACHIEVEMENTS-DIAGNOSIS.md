# Achievements with mods active

Goal: port bg3se's `EnableAchievements` option (Windows) to bg3le, so mods
do not silently block Steam achievements. **Status: done, validated live on
2026-09-23.** Address-level detail for every function named below is in
[PREDICATE-ANALYSIS.md](PREDICATE-ANALYSIS.md).

Every claim is tagged: `[LIVE]` confirmed in a running process, `[DISASM]`
read from objdump output, `[DECOMP]` from a decompiler, `[HYP]` hypothesis.

## How bg3se does it on Windows

bg3se patches two functions directly: `ls::ModuleSettings::IsModded` (forced
to always report "not modded") and `esv::SavegameManager::ThrowError` (its
warning branch NOP'd out). Both are same-size single-branch byte patches
found by AOB pattern scanning, since neither function is exported even on
Windows.

## What bg3le does

The Linux binary exports none of these names, but the same logic exists as a
small per-module "is this module official" predicate at raw VMA `0x37675f0`.
`ensure_achievement_gate_patch()` in `src/preload.cpp` overwrites its
prologue (`41 57 41 56 53 48 83 ec 50`, verified before writing) with
`b8 01 00 00 00 c3` (`mov eax,1; ret`). That is the direct equivalent of
bg3se's `IsModded` patch, one level below the consumers.

- Applied from the `bg3le_init` constructor, before `main` and before the
  game's `fork()`, so both processes and every session-load cache see it.
  Re-checked after `RegisterDIVFunctions` and once per server tick; the
  re-check is a `memcmp`, the patch is only written when missing.
- Only when `/proc/self/exe` is `bg3` and the target lies inside the main
  object's `.text` (`in_text()` in `src/hook.cpp`). `LD_PRELOAD` also lands
  in `steam-launch-wrapper` and `reaper`, and the first build crashed both
  by writing into whatever happened to sit at that offset.
- Off with `BG3LE_ACHIEVEMENTS=0` (unset or any other value means on), or
  with `"EnableAchievements": false` in `ScriptExtenderSettings.json` next
  to the game binary (bg3se parity, default true; `settings_flag()` in
  `src/console.cpp`).
- Log lines: `EnableAchievements: patched IsModded predicate at 0x37675f0`
  on success, `WARNING: EnableAchievements predicate patch refused` when the
  prologue bytes do not match (a new game build; see "Updating for a new
  binary" below). `Modded achievements enabled` is reported at story load,
  at the same point bg3se reports it.

## Why the mod gate is not one branch

The check is one small predicate, "is this module official", called from a
loop "does any module fail the predicate", and that loop is consulted by
several independent consumers, two of which cache the answer in a byte.
Patching a single consumer therefore changes nothing observable.

### Verified facts

| Raw VMA | Label | What it is | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x37675f0` | `FUN_038675f0` | Per-module predicate. Formats the module GUID at `entry+8` as `%08x-%04hx-...`, builds a FixedString from it, then compares that FixedString against a packed table of 19 official-module constants with SSE. Returns 1 for an official module. | `[DISASM]` `[DECOMP]` |
| `0x3767580` | `FUN_03867580` | `HasCustomMods(list)`. `list+0x14` = count, `list+8` = entries, stride `0x60`. Returns 0 if the list is empty or every entry passes the predicate, 1 if any entry fails it. Prologue `55 41 57 41 56 41 55 41 54 53 50`. | `[DISASM]` |
| `0x3767780` | `FUN_03867780` | Registered Osiris native for `UnlockAchievement` (id `0x80001669`). `if (!HasCustomMods(gEocServer+0x268)) ...` (server-side check #1). Hit 8 times in the child process during one achievement event, always with the check returning 1 while mods were active. | `[LIVE]` `[DECOMP]` |
| `0x3767800` | `FUN_03867800` | Called two steps later by the above; runs `HasCustomMods(gEocServer+0x268)` **again** (server-side check #2), then resolves the achievement through the manager at `gEocServer+0xb0`. | `[DECOMP]` |
| `0x3767890` | `FUN_03867890` | Sends `eocnet::AchievementMessage` (net id `0xb3`) to the character's user peer. | `[DECOMP]` |
| `0x3767230` | `FUN_03867230` | Sibling Osiris native (achievement progress), same `HasCustomMods` guard, sends net id `0xb9`. | `[DECOMP]` |
| `0x4019c40` | `FUN_04119c40` | Save/session load. `modded = (*(obj+0xf8) != 0) ? 1 : HasCustomMods(obj+0x20)`, stored into `param_1+0x87`: a cached per-session "IsModded" byte. | `[DECOMP]` |
| `0x2c2cb20` | `FUN_02d2cb20` | Load-status reporter behind the Load Game badges. Reads the `+0x87` cache and also has an inlined copy of the loop over `gEocServer+0x108`. The Linux shape of bg3se's `ThrowError` AOB. | `[DECOMP]` |
| `0x62be2ca` | `FUN_063be100` | Client mod-manager state: `HasCustomMods([r13+0x8b8]+0x198)` compared with the cached byte `[r13+0x828]`, stored on change. A second cached "IsModded" byte. | `[DISASM]` |
| `0x388e8e0` | `FUN_0398e8e0` | Called by the Osiris handler once check #1 passes. Resolves a GUID string to an entity handle; 337 callers. A generic helper, not "the unlock". | `[DECOMP]` |
| `0x34b2440` | client `ProcessMsg` | Branch `0x34b25fa..0x34b268b` handles net id `0xb3`: maps the user id, gets the achievements manager, calls `mgr->vtable[0xb8]` per id. | `[DISASM]` |
| `0x5078630` | manager `UnlockAchievement` | Returns if `mgr+0x84 == 0` (Steam stats not received yet), returns if already unlocked in its own cache, else calls the Steam wrapper. | `[DISASM]` |
| `0x6aa1170` | Steam wrapper | `ISteamUserStats::SetAchievement(def->name)` (vtable `+0x38`) and `StoreStats` (`+0x50`). | `[DISASM]` `[LIVE]` |
| process | topology | Two `bg3` PIDs, a real `fork()`. Game logic that touches `gEocServer` runs in the child. The child writes to the parent-named `bg3le.log.<parentpid>` through the inherited `FILE*`, so "the parent's log" is the shared log. Attach gdb to the child. | `[LIVE]` |

Address convention: `FUN_0xxxxxxx` labels are raw VMA + `0x100000` (the
convention the analysis was recorded in). Patching code uses raw VMA plus
the load bias, as `src/hook.cpp` does.

### The full chain, server to Steam

1. Server, Osiris native `UnlockAchievement` (`0x3767780`): check #1, then
   the GUID-to-entity helper (`0x388e8e0`), then `0x3767800`.
2. `0x3767800`: check #2, then the achievement lookup, then `0x3767890`.
3. `0x3767890`: sends `eocnet::AchievementMessage`, net id `0xb3`, to the
   character's user peer.
4. Client `ProcessMsg` (`0x34b2440`) dispatches it to the achievements
   manager.
5. Manager `UnlockAchievement` (`0x5078630`) calls the Steam wrapper
   (`0x6aa1170`), which calls `SetAchievement` and `StoreStats`.

The client side never calls the predicate, the loop, or reads `+0x87` or
`+0x828`. There is no client-side mod check; the only client gate is
`mgr+0x84` (Steam stats loaded). The Steam call is asynchronous to the
Osiris handler and crosses from the server process to the client, which is
why forward-searching from the handler for "the branch" kept failing.

### Coverage of the predicate patch

Opens checks #1 and #2 and every loop-based consumer, including both cached
"modded" bytes. Two inlined copies of the official-module compare remain
unpatched on purpose: `0x2c27ae0` (by-value variant) and `0x2e06590`
(module-settings validation). They affect load validation, not the unlock
or the badges. Patch them only if the badge test fails while the unlock
test passes.

## History: why a bypass came first

Before the predicate was found, an earlier version hooked Osiris' DIV
dispatch for `UnlockAchievement` (id `0x80001669`), walked the argument
list for the achievement name and called `ISteamUserStats::SetAchievement`
and `StoreStats` directly, with `BG3LE_ACHIEVEMENTS=0` turning it off. It
worked `[LIVE]` but was a bypass of the check rather than the check itself:
it did nothing for the Load Game badges, it depended on the Steam vtable
hook being installed before the first unlock, and it re-implemented the
client manager's own already-unlocked bookkeeping. Once the predicate was
mapped, the bypass and its forced Steam calls were removed.

An intermediate attempt NOP'd only check #1 (the `jne` at `0x37677a3`) and
saw no change, because check #2 in `0x3767800` sits two calls later. A
second contributor to that false negative: the client manager caches
"already unlocked" at startup, so clearing an achievement with the game
running makes the engine path skip silently while a direct Steam call still
shows a toast. Always clear achievements with the game closed.

## Live validation (2026-09-23)

With mods active and the predicate patched, killing the Adamantine Golem
unlocked `BG3_Quest33` with a real Steam toast, and the "no achievements"
and "modded" badges on the Load Game list disappeared. The `SetAchievement`
backtrace matched the mapped chain exactly: Steam wrapper `0x6aa119c`,
manager `0x50786ef`, client `ProcessMsg` `0x34b267f`. The control run with
the patch off showed the badges and produced no `SetAchievement` line.

## Updating for a new binary

When a game update moves the code, the patch refuses itself (the
`WARNING: ... refused` log line) and achievements simply stay mod-blocked.
To re-target: find the function that formats a module GUID with
`%08x-%04hx-%04hx-...` and compares the resulting FixedString index against
a run of 19 `.bss` globals; PREDICATE-ANALYSIS.md lists the globals, the
FixedString constructor and all callers of the current build to cross-check
against. Update `kAchievementPredicate` and `kAchievementPredicateBytes` in
`src/preload.cpp`, then run the A/B protocol in the runbook.

## Known limitations

- A pre-existing, unrelated bg3le bug crashes when `Osi.UnlockAchievement`
  is called on an **already-earned** achievement (a `COsiArgumentDesc`
  marshalling bug in `src/osi.cpp`, root cause still unknown).
- The two inlined copies of the official-module compare are left unpatched
  (see "Coverage" above).

## Lessons

- Never label a function until it is decompiled with clean noreturn flags;
  bogus `noreturn` on `strlen` and the FixedString constructor made the
  predicate look like a void function for several sessions.
- Every conclusion needs an A/B: mods off and mods on, same PID, same
  trigger.
- Attach to the child PID, verified with `PPid` in `/proc/<pid>/status`;
  log lines are shared between both processes.
- `LD_PRELOAD` reaches every process in the launch chain. Check the host
  binary and the target range before writing to code.
